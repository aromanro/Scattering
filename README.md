the theory is in chapter 2

The parameters and theory and experimental data can be found in "Molecular beam scattering studies of orbiting resonances and the determination of van der Waals potentials for H–Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe and for H2–Ar, Kr, and Xe", by J. Peter Toennies, Wolfgang Welz, and Günther Wolf, published in The Journal of Chemical Physics 71, 614 (1979), https://doi.org/10.1063/1.438414
